Requirements :
     Requires CMake version 2.6 or later
     Requires Python version 2.6 or later for testing

C implementation of a Markov Chain corpus generator with example program to generate random output.

Program corpus is used as a command line utility, simply invoke it and pipe the text to do the analyse on.

For each pairs of letters sitting next to one another an output is generated with the probability that the latter will follow the former.

BUILDING

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

If you're feeling truly daring then

make test

EXAMPLE

if your input is 'abab' then the following will be output :
a:b:1.00000
b:a:1.00000
